Shell is super easy :/

Important message from Julien
It’s time for the famous Simple Shell project. This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learn so far:

Basics of programming
Basics of C
Basics of thinking like an engineer
Group work
and Learning how to learn

I would like to take this moment to remind you about a few important things.

First, remember the framework. If you do not know it by heart already, it is probably a good idea to read it again: https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559

Note that there is no point in this framework that says it is ok to look at code from other people. It is not allowed to look at other people’s code, either other students or online articles or videos. At ALX SE we do not copy solutions and we do not look at it when we start a project.

In the context of learning (some of these will no longer be true when you work):

NEVER copy any code, never look at solution (and never give any solution to your friends, you are not helping them by doing so)
ALWAYS write code alone from scratch after you get help to check that you have actually understood. If you can not do it, you have not understood enough, and need to study more. Do not rewrite code from memory, but from understanding.
